# Professional Materials

Now that I've had some practice with APIs and have a project to share, I'll be updating my portfolio page and other materials to build toward being employer-competitive.

## Updated Portfolio

Your updated portfolio should:
- [x] Display your full name, email, and phone number
- [x] Have links to your GitHub profile and LinkedIn profile
- [x] Have a link to a downloadable PDF of your resume
- [x] Display at least 2 examples of student work from either deployed projects or homeworks. For each project, make sure you have the following:
    - [x] Project title
    - [x] Link to the deployed version
    - [x] Link to the GitHub repository
    - [x] Screenshot of the deployed application
- [x] Have a polished, mobile-responsive user interface.
